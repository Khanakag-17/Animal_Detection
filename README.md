# 🐾 Animal Detection

A deep learning-based multi-class animal detection system that identifies and classifies various animals in images. This project uses computer vision techniques and CNN-based models to detect animals such as dogs, cats, lions, elephants, and more.

> 🚧 Jupyter notebook coming soon — stay tuned!


## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the core logic for building and training a multi-class image detection model that can:
- Detect multiple types of animals in static images.
- Classify detected animals with high accuracy.
- Serve as a foundational module for wildlife monitoring, pet recognition, or zoo surveillance systems.
